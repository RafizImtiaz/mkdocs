## Difficulties & Findings

Configuration Complexity, finding and reordering a issue is very troublesome. Injecting from different source is impossible without knowing `laravel`.
Understanding github power is still unknown to me but learnt few things here and there.
Jira is really helpfull in ordered workflow.
